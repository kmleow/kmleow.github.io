      <description>I am Leow Kah Man, a Software Architect and Full Stack Software Developer, lives in Malaysia, likes just about anything that has to do with technology. I am extremely passionate about designing cloud architectures that drive new innovations, raise scalability and reduce time to deploy.
During my spare time, I like tinkering with OpenWRT and Raspberry Pi, and trying out new cloud services.
This blog was built using Hugo with CI deployment using GitLab.</description>
