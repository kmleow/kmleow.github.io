&lt;p&gt;I have upgraded to TM Unifi Turbo 800Mbps for quite some time but yet to realise
the speed promised by ISP. In my case, it is not fair to blame the ISP because the
bottleneck was not at their end, rather due to my router. When OpenWRT announced
the release of version 19.07, I took it for a spin and enabled the new flow offloading
feature. The performance increase was significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;CPU throttling, PC shutting down abruptly, etc. These may be signs of overheating.
Disabling Intel turbo boost may help. Screenshot above is the temperature range after
disabling turbo boost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My ISP provided D-Link DIR-615 G2 many years ago. Could not even remember how long
ago that was. After using for a short period of time, it was chucked away until
I found it yesterday while cleaning up my store room. I decided to flash it with
LEDE (also known as OpenWRT) to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to use Amazon Echo outside US but there are some challenges in
setting it up. Specifically, I was trying to setup for use in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TM Streamyx Router Wi-Fi Security</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are using the router that came with your telco provider,
please take immediate action to verify its security settings, in particular Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week while at someone else&amp;rsquo;s house,
I discovered that default settings of the router provided by telco had not one but
4 Wi-Fi SSIDs. One of them was already secured with a long WPA2 password, good.
However, the remaining 3 were without security.
Their SSIDs were hidden but hiding SSID is not a form of security!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TM provided an Android based set-top box (STB) for customers to watch HyppTV channels.
When starting up, Play Store icon appears on main screen but when attempting to
sign in, I kept getting a connection error message.
After spending a bit of time, I found the solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using rechargeable AA and AAA batteries for a few years throughout
my home and thought of doing a writeup on how it has been working for me and why
you should consider doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
