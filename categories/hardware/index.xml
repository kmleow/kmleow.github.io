&lt;p&gt;It is possible to use Amazon Echo outside US but there are some challenges in
setting it up. Specifically, I was trying to setup for use in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TM Streamyx Router Wi-Fi Security</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are using the router that came with your telco provider,
please take immediate action to verify its security settings, in particular Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week while at someone else&amp;rsquo;s house,
I discovered that default settings of the router provided by telco had not one but
4 Wi-Fi SSIDs. One of them was already secured with a long WPA2 password, good.
However, the remaining 3 were without security.
Their SSIDs were hidden but hiding SSID is not a form of security!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TM provided an Android based set-top box (STB) for customers to watch HyppTV channels.
When starting up, Play Store icon appears on main screen but when attempting to
sign in, I kept getting a connection error message.
After spending a bit of time, I found the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using rechargeable AA and AAA batteries for a few years throughout
my home and thought of doing a writeup on how it has been working for me and why
you should consider doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
