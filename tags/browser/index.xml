      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate websites that takes away the ability to right-click on the page.
This is nothing more than script kiddie level of protection for those that think
every visitor out there is a noob. You want to re-enable your rights to
right-click but before you jump into adding yet another addon or extension into
your web browser, it is good to find out if you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
