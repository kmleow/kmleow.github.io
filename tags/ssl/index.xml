      <title>Certificate error on blocked domains when using OpenDNS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenDNS helps in blocking malware sites by not resolving malware domains to the
actual IP address hosting the malware. Instead they resolve to an OpenDNS page
indicating &amp;ldquo;This domain is blocked due to &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;. If you are opening a non-SSL
page, this would work as described. However, when attempting to browse a malware
page via HTTPS, the web browser will show a certificate error instead.
Read on to know the reason and solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Apache CloudFlare Authenticated Origin Pulls configuration</title>
      <link>https://www.leowkahman.com/2016/03/10/apache-cloudflare-authenticated-origin-pulls-configuration/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Strict SSL enabled, CloudFlare is able to tell that my website is indeed
the real one. Furthermore, I have
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.leowkahman.com/2016/02/14/using-iptables-port-forward-to-web-server-only-if-source-is-cloudflare/&#34;&gt;restricted incoming IP addresses to CloudFlare ones&lt;/a&gt;.
This should be reasonably secure but an attacker could potentially spoof its
origin IP (man-in-the-middle attack) as one of theirs. To mitigate this
potential problem, it is necessary for the client (CloudFlare) to present a
certificate which is then verified by (my) web server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenSSL benchmark - RPi2B vs NAS vs Archer C7</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not short of options when it comes to spreading tasks over several
System-on-Chip (SoC) based low-powered micro computers. 4 devices were tested;
OpenWRT running on TP-Link Archer C7 v2, QNAP TS-220 and Asustor AS-304T and
Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In deciding which to be used for hosting a HTTPS-only web server, I was
interested in the cryptography (namely RSA and AES) performance thus the
motivation for running benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Port forward using iptables to web server only if source is CloudFlare</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking at my web server&amp;rsquo;s access logs, not surprisingly I discovered traffic
originating from IP addresses not belonging to CloudFlare. Initially, I was
using Apache .htaccess to allow incoming traffic only if they originated from
CloudFlare. This was somewhat sufficient but some hackers continued attempting
to find loopholes instead of giving up so I needed to up the level of security
and decided to look at ways to drop unwelcome traffic using OpenWRT firewall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
