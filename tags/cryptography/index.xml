      <title>Apache CloudFlare Authenticated Origin Pulls configuration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Strict SSL enabled, CloudFlare is able to tell that my website is indeed
the real one. Furthermore, I have
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.leowkahman.com/2016/02/14/using-iptables-port-forward-to-web-server-only-if-source-is-cloudflare/&#34;&gt;restricted incoming IP addresses to CloudFlare ones&lt;/a&gt;.
This should be reasonably secure but an attacker could potentially spoof its
origin IP (man-in-the-middle attack) as one of theirs. To mitigate this
potential problem, it is necessary for the client (CloudFlare) to present a
certificate which is then verified by (my) web server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not short of options when it comes to spreading tasks over several
System-on-Chip (SoC) based low-powered micro computers. 4 devices were tested;
OpenWRT running on TP-Link Archer C7 v2, QNAP TS-220 and Asustor AS-304T and
Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In deciding which to be used for hosting a HTTPS-only web server, I was
interested in the cryptography (namely RSA and AES) performance thus the
motivation for running benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
